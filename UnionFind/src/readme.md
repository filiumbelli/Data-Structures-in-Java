# Union Find
- Unify different groups(Magnet Example)
- Find the element that belongs to the groups
- Kruskal's minimum spanning tree
- Grid percolation
- Network Connectiviy
- Least common ancestor in trees
- Image processing
- Find Operation => following the parent nodes until the parent node of the node is itself.
- Union Operation => if parent nodes are different make one of the parent is parent of the other.
- Path Compression => 
--------------------------------
Complexity
- Mostly linear time

Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
- Main idea is to find MST.
- Minimum Spanning tree => Subset of the edges which connect all vertices in the graph with the minimal total edge cost.
- Graph => G = (V,E)


# Pretty Complex Should check at the end of the course
# Checked => No
