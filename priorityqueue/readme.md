# Priority Queue
- Same with queues but every element has priorities.
- Basically hospital patient system-> old|pregnant|urgent etc.
- Used in Dijkstra's shortest Path Alg.
- Next best | Next worst element problems
- Huffman Coding
- BFS Algorithms
- MST Algorithms
- Important in graph theory algorithms
- HashTable implementation in PQ's
- How binary heap construction is applied?
# Heaps
- Max|Min heaps
- Tree based data structures
- Binomial Heaps
- PQ uses heaps for best time complexity 

# The Difficulties
- Priority Queue uses TreeSet HashMap and List
- It also uses most of the advantages of these DS's.
- That's why prerequisites are too much for a beginner.
- Should watch the whole video and watch the some misunderstood or hard to understand parts again.
